It's not a catch all, but it does check most settings that the gallery requires.<br/><br/>If any of these tests fail with a <b><font color='#e0850f'>Warning</font></b>, the Expose gallery could run on your server. Sometimes little changes in the settings need to be done.<br/>When any test fails with a <b><font color='#bb0000'>Fatal Warning</font></b>, the Expose gallery will not run on your host without changing the server configuration files, which usually, only your host can do. A possible solution at warning or fail of the test is provided at this time.<br/><br/>If the component, after a successful report, still doesn't function, we suggest to <b>search the forum</b> at <a href='http://www.gotgtek.net/forum'>www.gotgtek.net/forum</a> for a fix.<br/>Please, before posting a new topic on the forum, also <b>check the manual</b> for installation, backup, configuration, security, troubleshooting and lots of other information.
